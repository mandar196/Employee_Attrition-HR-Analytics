# Predicting-Employee-Attrition

## Objective
Using machine learning to predict employee attrition in Python.

## Data Description 
The dataset consists of 25491 obseravtions and 10 variables. Each row in dataset represents an employee; each column contains employee attributes:

* satisfaction_level (0–1)
* last_evaluation (Time since last evaluation in years)
* number_projects (Number of projects completed while at work)
* average_monthly_hours (Average monthly hours at workplace)
* time_spend_company (Time spent at the company in years)
* Work_accident (Whether the employee had a workplace accident)
* left (Whether the employee left the workplace or not (1 or 0))
* promotion_last_5years (Whether the employee was promoted in the last five years)
* sales (Department in which they work for)
* salary (Relative level of salary)

## Approach
We perform turnover analysis project by using Python’s Scikit-Learn library. I have used Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Regressor for calculating Accuracy.
